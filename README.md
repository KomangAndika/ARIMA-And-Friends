# ARIMA-And-Friends
Explore and implement time series forecasting techniques using fundamental statistical models including Autoregressive (AR), Moving Average (MA), Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA).
I forecast BTC-USD price <br>
Of course there are some limitation like:<br>
- I am not well-versed in forecasting/time series problem.<br>
- Not enough data(only 350-ish were used in this project).<br>
- This is univariate so only one variable is used which may caused bias.<br>
- Granularity that I am choosing is may not suitable and causing white noise.<br>
- The model that I am using is not as sophisticated like RNN or LSTM.<br>
- There might be seasonality in the data which I can't seem to capture and making my prediction tanking :(<br>
While this might be incomplete, but in the future i want to incorporate more sophisticated method like RNN, LSTM, and XGBoost
